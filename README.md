# Resume-Classification-and-Screening.
# Business need: The document classification solution should significantly reduce the manual human effort in HRM. It should achieve a higher level of accuracy and automation with minimal human intervention. 

# Data Science Techniques used:

# Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary words in the Data, Removed Punctuations from Text, Removed URLs from text, Removed Stopwords, Applied Stemming, Applied, Lemmatization, Converted into Clean Resumes, Removed Url from, Clean_Resumes, Removed Emojis from Clean Resumes. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis: Checked Data Information, Checked for Null values, Checked for Duplicates. 

# Machine Learning Models: Support Vector Machine (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LGBM Boost, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

# Conclusion: In this project, we performed data cleaning on the resumes data to remove unnecessary words, URLs, stopwords, and applied stemming and lemmatization to convert the resumes into clean resumes. We then performed exploratory data analysis to check the data information, null values, and duplicates. Finally, we built machine learning models using SVC, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LGBM Boost, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the resume category. We chose the Random Forest model based on model complexity and accuracy.
